## Description:
wabe_pg_launcher is a wabe utility that provides seamless PostgreSQL client management for both development and production environments. In development, it utilizes an in-memory PostgreSQL instance for fast, lightweight testing and schema initialization using pg-mem. For production or staging environments, it connects to a real PostgreSQL database, leveraging environment variables for configuration. The project supports dynamic database setup, ensuring smooth transitions between local and cloud-based databases without the need for additional setup during development or continuous integration workflows.

### Features:
* In-memory PostgreSQL with pg-mem for fast, isolated testing.
* Dynamic environment handling for production and staging setups.
* Configurable via environment variables or fallback options.
* Automatic schema initialization for test environments.
* Handles real PostgreSQL connections for production use cases.


## A few "wired" or unusual things can raise questions at first glance but are correct within their intended context. Below are a few examples of these unusual aspects and why they are correct:

### Default Loopback Address ('0.0.0.0')

* Wired: The universalPort variable defaults to '0.0.0.0' if no loopback address is provided, which is an uncommon practice since most developers use localhost (127.0.0.1).

* Correct: `0.0.0.0` is a wildcard address that listens on all available network interfaces, meaning it can bind the server to all IP addresses. In contrast, localhost binds only to the local interface. This allows the application to accept connections from any interface, which can be useful in development or testing.
  
### Use case: You're testing your application in an environment where it needs to listen to external traffic (not just localhost), or you want to simulate this behavior in an in-memory PostgreSQL setup for wider network testing.

### Skipping In-Memory PostgreSQL if Real PostgreSQL is Running

* Wired: When PostgreSQL is already running on port 5432, the code skips the in-memory database setup, which might seem like a strange fallback mechanism.
  
* Correct: This behavior prevents redundant setups and saves resources. If the real PostgreSQL is available, it’s often preferable to use it, especially in a local development environment. This also allows seamless transitions between environments without requiring constant configuration changes.

### Use case: When multiple developers are working on the same machine or in a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, one may prefer to use the in-memory database for faster testing, while others rely on the real PostgreSQL instance for their own work.


### Dynamic Connection String Handling in Production

* Wired: In production mode, the code attempts to use process.env.DATABASE_URL first, and only if that’s not available, it falls back to manual connection details.
  
* Correct: This is a standard approach when working with modern cloud databases, where connection strings are provided by the hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS). The fallback mechanism ensures the code can still connect to PostgreSQL even if the environment is not set up with a connection string.
  
### Use case: In a cloud environment, PostgreSQL connection strings are often dynamically generated and provided in the form of a single DATABASE_URL variable. This fallback mechanism allows flexibility for local testing, where manual database configurations might still be used.
